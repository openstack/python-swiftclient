If you would like to contribute to the development of OpenStack,
you must follow the steps in this page: [http://docs.openstack.org/infra/manual/developers.html](http://docs.openstack.org/infra/manual/developers.html)

Once those steps have been completed, changes to OpenStack
should be submitted for review via the Gerrit tool, following
the workflow documented at [http://docs.openstack.org/infra/manual/developers.html#development-workflow](http://docs.openstack.org/infra/manual/developers.html#development-workflow).

Gerrit is the review system used in the OpenStack projects.  We're sorry, but
we won't be able to respond to pull requests submitted through GitHub.

Bugs should be filed [on Launchpad](https://bugs.launchpad.net/python-swiftclient),
not in GitHub's issue tracker.
