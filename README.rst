Python bindings to the OpenStack Object Storage API
===================================================

This is a python client for the Swift API. There's a Python API (the
``swiftclient`` module), and a command-line script (``swift``).

Development takes place via the usual OpenStack processes as outlined
in the `OpenStack wiki`__.  The master repository is on GitHub__.
